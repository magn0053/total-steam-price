# Total Steam Price
View the total price of all products on the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) store page. This is an extension of a project where I intend to include a lot more features, such as filters. See the original work [here](https://beta.magn0053.dk/steam/steamcompare/totalPrice)


# Testing
For testing I'm running everything locally - to test POST requests I'm using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)


# Just a practial note
It's my first time really working open-source and using GitHub - any tips and tricks are very welcome!
